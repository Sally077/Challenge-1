# <01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor>

## Description

My task was to complete an on-the-job ticket on the html code for challenge-1. I was give HTML code to adapt and make this more accessible using **accessibility** the exisiting code needed refactoring to make sure that coding  conventions were up to date and met legal acessibility requirements.

I did not build the current project as it was a ticket task and the aims of the project were to understand how to refactor **accessibility** this enabled me to look at the semantics of the written elements and change them to concise descriptive code.

I learned how the structure of the elements worked and familiarised myself with the order and learned that by using naming conventions it made the code easier to read for example I changed the navigation bar from **div** to **nav**.
I gained a better understanding of the layout of the web page by placing **section** code and replacing the **div**. I also labelled the **header** and **footer** areas in my HTML document.

I had a couple of issues when changing the div tags when I added an **alt** tag to the main boardroom image called **.hero**. I had to remove the alt text as it removed the image and I was unsure how to correct this. The second issue that I had was that when I removed the span code it moved the text and I was unsure how to change this. I opted for adding the **em** feature to italicise the text and make the **SEO** text stand out from the title.

I added alt tags to the other image elements and used text that reflected the nature of the image.

After completing the HTML mark up I went into the CSS code and added comments. I could only see one change that was physically needed in the HTML code and changed the **div** for the navigation to **nav**.

In the comments I added descriptions of how each part was supposed to work and some comments on the changes that I made to the Mark Up language.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

My code does not currently need an install and can be viewed directly through the URL.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

![alt text](/assets/index.html/image.png) **needs fixing**
![alt text](first-Challenge/Assets/first-Challenge\Assets\01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png) **this one too**

## Credits

There were no collaborators in this task.

I used a couple of websites to help me identify the semantic elements https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp and https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/imageshtml/#:~:text=ALT%20attribute%20(HTML)%20%E2%80%93%20In,reference%20to%20the%20ALT%20attribute. .

I followed the bootcamp zoom tutorial recording on how to set up my inital project folders and push them onto git using the terminal. 
I used the bootcamp precourse work video tutorial on how to add and push content onto git.
